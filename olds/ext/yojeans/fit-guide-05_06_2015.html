<div class="fit-guide">
<p>We have a detailed yet easy-to-understand fit guide for you so that you buy only what you really need.</p>
<h3>What is True Waist Size?</h3>
<p>While buying jeans online, many people suffer the same fate; their jeans don&rsquo;t fit well on the waist. Either the waist size is too big, meaning the jeans keep falling off, or the jeans don&rsquo;t even come up till the waist, which clearly means the jeans don&rsquo;t correspond to your waist&rsquo;s size. But wait; is this a folly on your part? Guess what, it&rsquo;s a problem on the part of online sellers and not of the buyers.</p>
<p>Not many people are actually aware of the fact, that a 32 Size pair of jeans is not actually 32 inches in waist. Surprised? A denim jean tagged as &lsquo;32&rsquo; could actually mean a True Waist Size of anything between 33-35 inches which varies basis the brand you are purchasing. For this very reason, a lot of times, you will feel a &lsquo;32&rsquo; tagged jeans of Brand X will fit you like a second skin while another pair of jeans, with the same tag &lsquo;32&rsquo;, from Brand Y, does not fit you at all. Every brand markets its product sizes differently, and what you see on the Size Tag, is not ideally the true waist size.</p>
<h3>How does the concept of True Waist Size fit in?</h3>
<p>With this concept in mind, a buyer will often wonder if it&rsquo;s beneficial to purchase jeans online. The answer is yes, it is. This is where we go a step further. Our in-house team measures each pair of jeans for True Waist Size carefully before putting it on display on our website. We erase the typical brand size tag format to help you find a perfect pair of jeans (from any brand) that fits like a glove!</p>
<h3>True Waist Sizes categorized</h3>
<p>In order to help our buyers make their selections more appropriately, we have categorized jeans&rsquo; true waist sizes in the following manner:</p>
<div class="sizerow">
<div class="sizelist"><span>28-29 inches</span> <span>30-31 inches</span> <span>32-33 inches</span> <span>34-35 inches</span> <span>36-37 inches</span> <span>38-39 inches</span> <span>40-41 inches</span></div>
</div>
<p>So in case your true waist size is 34.5 inches, you should choose a pair of jeans from the category 34-35 inches on our website. However, before you make a purchase, it&rsquo;s advisable to measure your true waist size correctly and accurately as described below on this page.</p>
<h3>What if my true waist size is in the middle of 2 categories?</h3>
<p>The answer to this question fairly depends on your own personal choice. Thankfully, your choice will correspond to the way you want jeans to look on your waist. If you are someone, who likes to have a pair of tight fitting jeans on their waist, then you should choose from the lower category. On the contrary, if you like to wear slightly loose fitting jeans, it&rsquo;s best to choose from the higher category. For a good fit, we recommend you choose from the higher waist size category in this case.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-measure-waist-size">How to Measure Waist Size</h3>
<div class="fit-guide-img left">
<p><strong>Measure over your body</strong></p>
<p>The best way to figure out your correct true waist size is to measure around the point of your waist where you usually wear your jeans. Determine how high on your waist or hip you like to wear jeans and measure at this point. Keep the measuring tape slightly squeezed while you measure as your denims tend to stretch after they are worn a few times. Make sure to measure the true waist size over your body and not over your clothes.</p>
<p>Check out the video and follow the directions on how to measure your true waist size over your body.</p>

<div class="fit-guide-img left">
<h3>Measure your perfect fitting jeans</h3>
<p>Take your favorite pair of jeans, button it up and turn the waistband inside out. Get a measuring tape, put it over the back of the button of your jeans and start sliding the measuring tape over the waistband till you reach the button again. You can note the measurement and that&rsquo;s your jeans&rsquo; true waist size.</p>
<p>Check out the video and follow the directions on how to measure the true waist size of your favorite jeans, correctly.</p>

<h3>What if you don&rsquo;t have a tailor&rsquo;s measuring tape?</h3>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t have a tailor&rsquo;s measuring tape at the time of measuring your favorite pair of jeans, you can still use a normal string. All you have to do is treat the string like a normal measuring tape, mark out the size and measure it on a scale (ruler) later on, for accurate and precise measurements.</p>

<h3>Skinny Fit:</h3>
<p>Skinny fit jeans are primarily what the name spells out. Belonging to the extremely tight category, skinny fit jeans are usually stitched with a narrow bottom. Available in a low rise version, skinny fit jeans are made for people who like jeans to cling to the skin. Narrowness tapers from the waist to the hem, giving an effect of closely fitted jeans. However, if you are a fan of comfort, then this might not suit your requirements.</p>
<h3>Slim Fit:</h3>
<p>The slim fit category of jeans is the most sought after design in the denim industry today. Boasting of a fitting which is neither too tight nor too loose, the slim fit jeans are a little more relaxed on the seat and the thighs. A slim fit pair of jeans will often be seen to have a tapered leg opening, which is further best suited with low to mid rise waist designs. Slim fit jeans are also available in straight leg options. This design is ideal for people who seek comfort, yet style in their jeans.</p>
<h3>Regular Fit:</h3>
<p>If you seek a more formal design for your jeans, then the regular fit jeans are going to fit you like a glove. Being the widest of all denim designs, this kind of fit is extremely relaxed and is available in mid- rises as well as high rises. Couple this up with a tapered as well as straight leg options, and you will have a lot to choose from. If extreme comfort is your middle name, then you know which kind of design to choose from.</p>
